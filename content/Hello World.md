Hey, welcome to my blog.

I'm Trial, a twenty-*something* year old LARPing as a gnome on the interwebs.

As of writing this post, I've spent 6+ years following crypto related content, be it history, flipping shitcoins, ideology, getting rugged or the technology behind it.

That being said, it's not the *only* thing I know or care about. Over the years I've amassed swathes of knowledge and ideas, realised a few, discussed some, forgotten many. Hence, this blog and a website.

Despite my lack of programming skills, I do know a thing or two about the [Open Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) ideology, and Its goals. The more I researched, the more I found myself being aligned with the vision. Genuine amazement witnessing selfless people sharing their knowledge and findings for others to learn, implement and improve upon. 
Browsing video after video on youtube, reading the comments where people shared their stories and experiences *Damn, I wish I was able to share what I know with the rest of the world like [No Boilerplate](https://www.youtube.com/@NoBoilerplate) or [Eric Murphy](https://www.youtube.com/@EricMurphyxyz).* 
**Then it clicked.**  *Hol' up, actually, I can!*
While I don't have the expertise, I don't *need* to have it. That's the whole point!

`I share what I know to the people, and the people can decide whether or not to add to it, to make it better if they want`!

So if you're able to read this now it means I've succeeded in setting up the website and finally launched the damn blog (seriously, It's been thrown to back-burner for more than 8 times..)!

This blog will be hectic, inconsistant, often contain completely random topics about the many things that I find fascinating and worth to discuss or just my rants. 

Either way, thank you for joining me on my journey and I hope you can find something of value here.

May your M's always be G.

Trial
